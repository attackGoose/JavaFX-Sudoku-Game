# JavaFX-Sudoku-Game
This is a re-attempt of my sudoku project that I had started previously

In this project, I'm creating a sudoku game that utilizes the wave function collapse algorithm to automatically solve itself when it get stuck, I'm also plannning on combining a backtracking algorithm in the future incase this algorithm ever gets stuck
